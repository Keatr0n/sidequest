# sidequest

I kinda wanted a todo list tracker that was a bit more fun than just a list of things to do. So I made this.
It's based off of the idea of a quest log in an RPG. You have a list of quests, with different levels of importance, and a clear set of objectives to complete them.

I also wanna add a bit of AI to it, so it can automatically generate quests based on a title, but that's a bit further down the line.

Might also add a bit of a reward system, maybe with xp or something, to sorta make it more of the RPG experience.
Also kinda wanna add some multiplayer functionality, so you can have a party of people working on the same quests, or perhaps a way to assign quests to other people.
